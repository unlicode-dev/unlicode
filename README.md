# Unlicode

An Open Source IDE with Unlimited Tokens/Request for Agents Powered by Local LLM's.

## Motivation
Developers today face token limits, request caps, and privacy concerns when using cloud-based AI assistants.  
Unlicode removes those barriers by running local LLMs, giving you:
- Unlimited tokens and requests.
- Full data privacy (everything stays local).
- Agent workflows without restrictions.


## Features

### Software Engineer(SWE) Agent
Based on the popular Kilo Code extension, Unlicodeâ€™s SWE Agent allows you to select local or online LLMs, including:  
- Qwen Coder, GLM Air, Claude, and more.  
- Full support for top-ranked LLM models.

### Local LLM Optimization
Supercharge your local LLM to run faster and smarter. Experience higher throughput (TPS) and optimized performance across CPU and GPU setups.  
- Seamless integration with AMD, Nvidia and other dedicated GPU's.  
- Speed, Quality and Accuracy improvements for the selected local LLM.

### Privacy & Security
Your code, prompt's, and context never leave your machine. Unlicode ensures all communication between your IDE and local LLM remains private and secure.  

### Open Source
Unlicode is fully open source, allowing everyone to contribute, review, and improve:  
- Publicly accessible for security audits and bug reports.
- Community-driven updates and feature enhancements.
